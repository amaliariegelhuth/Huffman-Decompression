    // Here's where you want to do your STEP 2. Don't forget that you
    // will want to create a separate class for HuffTree outside this class.

    // USING FileIOC TO WRITE OUT TO A BINARY FILE

    // Here is some code that shows you how to use FileIOC to write out a binary file.
    // Below are just some examples of what you can do with BinaryOut. You don't need
    // to use all of this code, of course.

    // BTW, this is where you'll be doing STEP 3.

    // FileIOC uses the S&W BinaryOut class, which lets you write to binary a file.
    // FileIOC will automatically open a file with the same name as your input file
    // but it will replace .txt with .zip.
    BinaryOut bo = fioc.openBinaryOutputFile();

    // The BinaryOut class has a write() method that can print out all the
    // primitive data types to binary. Here are some examples, below.

    // This line prints out the "signature" two bytes that begin one of our zip files.
    // A short is a two-byte datatype, so use a short.
    short s = 0x0bc0;
    bo.write(s);
    bo.write(frequencyMap.size());


    for (Map.Entry<String, Info> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()){
      bo.write(entry.getKey().charAt(0), 8); //for each entry key, writes it in 8 bits
      bo.write(entry.getValue().getFreq()); //writes the values frequency
    }
    FileIOC newfioc = new FileIOC();
    FileReader newfr = newfioc.openInputFile(args[0]);
    while ((c = newfr.read()) != -1) { //goes through all the characters and translates them to huffcode which is translated by the methods to hex
      String huff = frequencyMap.get(Character.toString((char) c)).getHuffCode();
      int huffInt = Integer.parseInt(huff, 2);
      bo.write(huffInt, huff.length());
    }

    // Suppose after you build your Huffman binary tree, the code for T
    // ends up being 101. Here's one way you can print that out to the binary file.
    // String t = "101";
    // int i = Integer.parseInt(t, 2);
    // bo.write(i, t.length());


    // A boolean is the only type that has two values, so you can pass in a boolean
    // to the write() method of the BinaryOut class to print out a single bit.
    // Here's how you could write out 101 using individual bits.
    // bo.write(true);
    // bo.write(false);
    // bo.write(true);
    // You have to close the file, just the way you would in Python.
    fr.close();


    // One last thing: files have to be written in bytes not bits. The BinaryOut
    // write() method will bunch your bits together into bytes for you, but
    // when you write out your compressed file, so you might end up with some
    // number of bits that isn't divisible by 8. Thus, at the end of your file,
    // you need to "flush" the output, as shown below. flush() will add 0s at
    // the end of your file until you complete a byte.
    bo.flush();

    // Do this to close the output stream.
    bo.close();
